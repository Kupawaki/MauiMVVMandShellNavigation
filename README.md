# MauiMVVMandShellNavigation

This week served as an introduction to shell navigation, which turned out to be so simple that I moved on to MVVM and data binding, which was so complex I still don't quite understand it.
I also discovered Nuget packages which are community libraries that can be installed for a variety of reasons.
In my case I installed CommunityToolkit.MVVM, which is maintained by Microsoft, and is commonly used across the board for MVVM creation.

### Lessons
- Nuget Packages are amazing
- CommunityToolkit.MVVM is great
- Auto-generated code really saves me some time, but is messy and hard to understand

#### Important Sources

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qga2pniN78) - A video where I got the majority of the binding information from
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/ - the .NET MAUI docs. You can go under deployment, then publish, then your platform to find instructions on how to publish an app on any supported platform.
